All dirs include an .in file and a startingstate.

1 - Copy them to the directory where you want to run.
2 - Copy in that directory the potential that you want to use,
    and fix its name and path in the .in file
3 - Run LAMMPS:
    <path>/lmp -in run_*.in -var seed $RANDOM
    (the seed is used to initialize the velocities, $RANDOM is a bash command)
